Task description: Create a simple web application in Node.js that allows users to "check-in" at various locations like on Foursquare. You only need to implement the server side â€” no web pages required, just an API. The information should be stored in MongoDB using Mongoose. Two API endpoints must work: 1. Check in: For a user to check in to a location. They provide input their username and location via GET parameters in the URL. 2. Query: Return all previous check-ins for a given name or for a given location as JSON
